Players can *shift* to sneak.
Sneaking allows them to be hidden if no mobs or players can see them (invisible or behind the player)
The hidden status comes from the mob/player that the user is looking at.

While sneaking
	If player is hidden from the entity
		The player can steal from other players or mobs inventories by RClicking on them form behind

		Only 1 item from player inventory per steal with a chance of warning the other player that the steal has happened and a cooldown per steal
		Mobs will use a loottable drops or defined by config
		Mobs will NOT be affected by 1 item per steal or cooldown

	Render icon for hidden/detected
		Icon pops up and fades shortly after when stance changes
